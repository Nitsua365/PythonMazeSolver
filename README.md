This is a image maze solver that accepts PNG mazes and solves them! Uses three algorithms Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search (WIP), and Dijkstra (WIP)

# Input constraints:
  - Image must be a PNG
  - Image cant be a circular maze
  - Image must have a entrance at the top and the bottom
  - Image must be black and white
